This was an early attempt at REALLY starting to understand the basics of linear regression. I decided writing my own linear regression function in R would be a good way to do that. Obviously this doesn't use anything like QR decomposition, I just wanted to get the mechanics down. For anybody looking to do something like this to learn, note that this was something I would tweak and change to understand the effects of different operations.
